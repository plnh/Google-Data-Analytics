Hello, my name is Joseph. I'm a people analyst at Google. As a people analyst, my job is to work with executives and HR business partners to use data to make informed
people decisions. Inclusion is very essential
to the work that we do. As you know, sometimes
you can start with data and have your
own bias in it. For us in this field
that is very sensitive, it requires that we have a
diverse set of people who have different backgrounds to have this lens of data to work. Being a black professional, I can better tell a story
about people of color that is a lot more
personal to me. Being an analyst requires me to take data and tell
a story with it. On a personal standpoint, I'm very passionate
about this space of increasing representation
in the tech industry. For example, outside of work, I run a nonprofit
called Sankofa Tech. Our whole goal is essentially to help develop the
next generation of black engineers who
can essentially be in this field and represent
our experience using data as a foundation
and offer technology as the powering moving
factor going forward. It's critical that we have more black people in
the technology sector. As you all know, in the
next 10-20 years, AI, machine learning,
will be like just speaking English in this country
or even the entire world. So the more we can have more
black people in this field, the more we can represent it in the products that
are being built, and the more that our
experiences are being influenced in every single product that
these companies do build. It's definitely critical that we have more black engineers, we have more black data
scientists to do the analysis, and also just black data
analysts to help tell the story that's more inclusive of our
experience as well. It's definitely essential that
we do have people from different backgrounds,
colors, creeds to really understand data, and have the alliance to it, and tell the story, and make it very personal
to our audience.
